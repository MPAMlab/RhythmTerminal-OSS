# Rhythm Terminal

This is a project that can emulate a card reader and key inputs for certain rhythm games.

This project heavily referenced	codes from https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/PN5180-cardio, based on that, we have implemented with more controlling buttons and a highly-customized case.

This project involved AI-generated codes.
